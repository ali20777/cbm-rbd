\begin{abstract}
CBM when no (continuous) degradation signal for system available, but status of components observable (works yes/no)

use method from asce-asme paper:
gives delay time distribution, base maintenance decision directly on that
(via threshold for reliability?)

Bayesian approach allows
component models to include expert info, test data (if available), and status of components in the running system
(write down explicit formula for test data including censored observations)

main message: can do cbm without degradation signal,
useful for redundant systems,
method reflects aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in all information sources

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

CBM usually with directly or indirectly observable continuous measurable condition / degradation signal,
delay time (time till failure) via distance of current signal level to fixed known failure threshold
%but in practice threshold often not known

here we propose a different approach to CBM: if no degradation signal for system available,
use system layout (reliability block diagram) and information on components' status:
need only to observe when a component fails,
and expert information about expected component failure times.

i.e., parametric model not for a degradation signal of the system or delay time, but for component lifetimes:
we use the well-known Weibull model for component lifetimes.
To keep the model simple, we assume known shape parameter,
and that components fail independently.
these simplifying assumptions might not hold in practice,
then model can serve as approximation.

The Bayesian approach to the Weibull model allows to integrate, for each component type,
three sources of information: expert knowledge, data from component tests,
and status of components in the monitored system, i.e., current system condition.

Furthermore, our method appropriately reflects epistemic uncertainty,
by using parametric p-boxes, an imprecise probability model, for the component models.

epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty: big topic in reliability and risk

***refer to Terje Aven, NASA Langley UQ challenge, illustration that uniform distribution does not express ignorance (Edoardo Patelli)***

The proposed system delay time model adequately reflects uncertainty in the delay time distribution
according to the current system status,
in particular making more cautious predictions when failure behaviour in the monitored system
seems to deviate from what is expected from expert knowledge and test data.

Expert input in our model is, for each component type,
Weibull shape parameter, range of expected failure time (translated to scale parameter),
and range of expert info weight (how sure about mean failure time guess).
By using ranges we do a systematic sensitivity analysis.

Our model gives the lower and upper delay time distribution at $\tnow$,
taking current system condition into account.

We need additional criteria to indicate repair now yes/no.
(Could indicate which failed component(s) to repair best.)


\subsection{Literature***}

Example for Bayesian method in maintenance planning: \cite{2007:wang-jia}

***Wang \& Jia (2007) propose a model that uses Bayesian updating,
but the model aims to identify an optimal inspection interval.
This is CBM via inspections, not CBM via continuous monitoring as we aim to do.

\begin{scriptsize}
Wang \& Jia (2007) have a model for defects arrival (homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, so no aging),
model for delay time (time between defect and failure) is Weibull $h \sim \wei(\alpha,\beta)$,
and each of $\lambda, \alpha, \beta$ has a Gamma prior distribution.
The expected overall cost rate is then used to find a cost-optimal inspection interval.
For this they assume that failures are immediately repaired,
and defects found in an inspection are repaired during inspection.

They use prior predictive distributions for certain statistics (number of defects, number of failures, \ldots between $0$ and $T$)
to obtain prior values for the Gamma hyperparameters,
by solving prior predictive equations -- but give no detail on how they actually do this.

In the end they actually do not advocate to calculate the posterior expected cost rate (15),
but rather plug in posterior estimates for $\lambda, \alpha, \beta$,
so neglecting uncertainty in estimation.
(We do not assume a parametric distribution for delay time,
it rather arises as a consequence of the system layout and component failure distributions.)

\end{scriptsize}

Example for Bayesian method in CBM with continuous monitoring: \cite{2011:elwany-et-al}
(exponential degradation model, whose parameters $\theta'$ and $\beta$ each have a prior
which is updated using the degradation signal history,
and use total expected infinite-horizon discounted cost to determine the maintenance policy)


\section{***summary of ASCE-ASME paper method}

sets of priors on component survival,
survival signature,
test data inclusion,
noninformatiove censoring,
set of system reliability curves as output,
wider set in case of prior-data conflict


\section{***extensions to ASCE-ASME paper}

repaired components: separate type in survival signature,
but same hyperparameter learning (using actual age).


\section{***from (set of) survival curves to maintenance decision}

infinite-horizon cost rate $g(\tau)$ (discounted as well?)
like in age-based policy:
this indicates in how much time from now ($\tnow$) it is economical to repair the system
\begin{align*}
g(\tau) &= \frac{ECC(\tau)}{ECL(\tau)} = \frac{c_p \Rsys(\tau) + c_u \big(1-\Rsys(\tau)\big)}{\tau \Rsys(\tau) + \int_0^\tau \Rsys(t) \dd t}
\end{align*}
and $\tau^* = \arg\min g(\tau) - \tnow$ is the cost-optimal repair time from now
($\Rsys(\cdot)$ is always in terms of time since system startup)

Sets of $\Rsys(t)$: need to determine sets of $g(\tau)$.
for each $\tau$, fix $\Rsys(\tau) \in [\lRsys(\tau), \uRsys(\tau)]$ and optimize $I(\tau) = \int_0^\tau \Rsys(t) \dd t$:
\begin{itemize}
\item nonpar.: $\ol{I}(\tau)$ by $\uRsys(t)$, $\ul{I}(\tau)$ by $\lRsys(t)$ until level of $\Rsys(\tau)$.
\item par.: optimize over $\nkzfun{1} \in \left[\nkzlfun{1}, \nkzufun{1}\right], \ldots, \nkzfun{K} \in \left[\nkzlfun{K}, \nkzufun{K}\right]$\\
(is $g(\tau)$ indeed monotone in $\ykzfun{1}, \ldots \ykzfun{K}$?)
\end{itemize}

From sets of $g(\tau)$ to (set of) $\tau^*$:
worst case, best case, interval (how?)

Or, alternatively, simple 95\% policy? repair time from now such that system failure probability is below 5\%


\section{Case study / numerical example}

what system layout? something that demonstrates the power of the method (complex layout) or something simple?

complex: e.g., bridge system where each of the four elements is a two out of three, and the bridge element is a two-parallel.


\section{Outlook}

*** to add timing of next inspection into the model we would need to add interval-censored data
(failure has happened between last and current inspection)

*** if repaired/exchanged components are present in system,
the one needs to use actual ages (and not time since system startup) in parameter update,
introduces new component type for $\Rsys(t)$ calculation but with same posterior parameters as unreplaced component type
